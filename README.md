## **Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:**

- What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?

    understand and practice authentication/authorization, nested resources; more MVC practice

- What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?

    Mary prefers pairs but wants a remote job; Anten likes pairing but fine with divide-and-conquer; Mary B is working on how to exist in paired project; Michael prefers divide-and-conquer; two is a good pair

- How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?

    Mary G prefers direct communication; Mary B echoes this; Making sure everyone's voice is heard and has equal input.

- How would you describe your work style?

    Mary B just wants to practice and views the project as a way to learn but not focus on the endpoint; Mary G enjoys finishing projects but understands there are realistic expectations and people can get to the point where they aren't learning anymore and being aware of that is key to success. 

- What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
    - Mary B - TDD, enjoys front end
    - Mary G - TDD; heroku deployment; MVC general layout; weak - front end
    - Anten - weak - design
    - Michael - design; weak - activerecord

    - Michael - poor - when people feel that their voice isn't heard
- How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
    - Mary B - making sure we organize our backend first

    - Michael - agreeing on design implementations before implementation
- How will we overcome obstacles?
    - Mary G - technical - talk to each other and don't be afraid to ask for help; communication - slack and work through
